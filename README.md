# Welcome to FileSync
FileSync is a tool for keeping file backups up to date without going through the hassle of re-copying the entire directory every time the backup needs to be updated. FileSync compares the last modified date of each file in the backup with each file in the source directory and only copies files that are either missing from the backup or were modified more recently than the backup copy. Super handy when you've got 15GB of files from three years of engineering that you want to back up but don't want to wait an hour every time you want to update the backup.

I made this as a fun way to solve the issues I've had with trying to back up all the files from my classes. Sure, I could have gotten some backup software off of the internet, but that wouldn't have been nearly as fun as making my own simple file backup program. It was fun to try out some of the things I've learned recently and make an MVC application that I'm confident in the MVC-ness of!
